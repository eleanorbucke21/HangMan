## Responsiveness
 [Am I Responsive?](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#) was used to check responsiveness of the site pages across different devices.
 
 The site has been tested on various sizes such as those listed below.
 
 Mobile:
 375x667 / 360x740 / 412x915 / 414x896
 
 Tablet:
 768x1024 / 820x1180 / 912x1368 
 
 Monitor:

### Testing

* PEP8 was deprecated so I used pycodestyle to test my code.
* I found that three of my lines of code were too long :
    * Line 36.
    * Line 50.
    * Line 52.

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs

* When testing I found that you could also enter numbers or symbols for a user name. 
* I corrected this by adding this code:

## Deployment
### Gitpod
This website was written on Gitpod.
* Navigate to [Gitpod] through [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).
* In the browserâ€™s address bar, prefix the entire URL with gitpod.io/# and press Enter.
* For example, gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gitpod-io/website.
* We recommend you install the Gitpod browser extension to make this a one-click operation.
* Sign in with one of the listed providers and let the workspace start up.
* Congratulations, you have started your first of many ephemeral developer environments!

### Heroku
This website was deploed on Heroku. 
* When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

    1. `heroku/python`
    2. `heroku/nodejs`

* You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`
* If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.
* Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.
